# Camouflage Object Detection with YOLOv8

## Overview

This project aims to detect camouflaged objects using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The system leverages YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with image files. Built using PyTorch and utilizing a dataset from Roboflow, the project may be expanded in the future to include video processing capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for fast and accurate object detection.
- **User Interface**: Enables image uploading and downloading with ease.
- **Visual Outputs**: Provides visual results of detected objects.
- **Future Expansion**: Plans to include video processing capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab or a local environment with internet access

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   You can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file included in the repository.
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, install the required libraries individually:
   ```sh
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python
   ```

4. **Upload and Prepare Dataset**:
   - Upload your dataset to your environment or extract it to the designated directory.
   - Ensure the dataset is structured according to the project's requirements.

## Getting Started

### 1. Data Preparation

- Extract and upload your dataset to the specified directory.
- Verify that paths and configurations are correctly set in your training and inference scripts.

### 2. Model Training

- Run the training script to train the YOLOv8 model on your dataset. Ensure that your training configuration (e.g., dataset paths and hyperparameters) is set up correctly.

### 3. Object Detection

- Use the trained model to perform object detection on images.
- Process the results and save or download the output images as needed.

## Running the Project

1. **Train the YOLOv8 Model**:
   Execute the training script to train the model. Make sure to adjust paths and parameters according to your dataset and requirements.

2. **Perform Object Detection**:
   Run the detection script on your images. The results will be saved in the specified output directory.

## File Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing dataset and configuration files.
- `model/`: Directory containing the trained model and images.
- `output_image.jpg`: Output image with detected objects.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the necessary Python libraries for the project.

## Future Enhancements

- **Video Processing**: Extend functionality to support video files for real-time object detection.
